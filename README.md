## About me

I am a Python developer with an aviation background, contributing to open-source projects such as [AIR](https://github.com/feldroy/air).

I am interested in backend systems, data pipelines, and domain-specific tooling, particularly where correctness, structure, and real-world constraints matter. My work often involves reading specifications, working with imperfect data, and turning it into reliable software.

I enjoy collaborating in established codebases, improving documentation, writing tests, and making small, incremental improvements that compound over time.

I am interested in long-term open-source collaboration and mentorship, and in contributing to projects with active communities and clear technical direction.
